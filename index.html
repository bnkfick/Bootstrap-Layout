    <h1>Bootstrap 4 Reboot</h1>
    <h2><a href="https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/">Built on top of Normalize</a></h2>
    <p>For improved cross-browser rendering, Bootstrap uses <a
            href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.2/content/reboot/">Reboot</a> to correct inconsistencies across
        browsers and devices while providing slightly more opinionated resets to common HTML elements.
    </p>
    <p>
        Normalize.css makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards. It
        precisely targets only the styles that need normalizing.</p>

    <h1>Different from Bootstrap 3</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Simplified Navigation</li>
        <li>Some appearance font, color etc. No longer ships with glyphicons</li>
        <li>Bootstrap 3 had used Normalize.css in order to render all the HTML elements their consistent appearance.
            Bootstrap 4 adopted an enhanced version of Normalize.css</li>
        <li>Grid System &mdash; grid tier system lets the version 4 enjoy the presence of up to 5 grid tiers</li>
        <li>Adopting Flexbox which does not replace the already existing page layout.</li>
        <li>Bootstrap 4 offers an improved form control.</li>
        <li>In the version 4, dropdown item class needs to be applied to every dropdown item. </li>
        <li>Now, Bootstrap 4 demands one to properly indicate pagination and link items using page-item as well as
            page-link class.</li>
        <li>As in Bootstrap 3, plugins were divided into two categories, namely, a file including style rules and a
            Javascript file. There arenâ€™t any significant changes as to how the plugins are compiled in Bootstrap 4
            either. In the latest version, style rules are composed using SASS. Whereas, plugins are available under the
            global jQuery object as the Javascript file contains a jQuery section.</li>
        <li>Bootstrap 4 offers its immense support to all the major and renowned browsers of all times, like, Safari,
            Chrome, Opera and Internet Explorer (10, and above) etc. <strong>If you require IE8-9 support, use Bootstrap
                3.</strong></li>
        <li>In Bootstrap 4, new utility classes have been included without hampering any existing functionality,
            whatsoever. Such important additions are as that of responsive text alignment classes, responsive floats,
            and responsive embedding. Apart from offering many shortcuts, these, respectively, allow for changing the
            alignment of the text, floating of the elements and the scaling of the aspect ratio of any embedded media.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <form>
        <label></label>
        <input type="text" placeholder="placeholder" />
        <input type="submit" value="Click me" />
    </form>
